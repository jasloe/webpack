                She is Professor of Classics at the University of Cambridge, a
                fellow of Newnham College, and Royal Academy of Arts Professor
                of Ancient Literature. She is the Classics editor of The Times
                Literary Supplement, where she also writes a regular blog,
                <a
                  href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/categories/regular-features/mary-beard-a-dons-life/"
                  >"A Don's Life"</a
                >. Her frequent media appearances and sometimes controversial
                public statements have led to her being described as "Britain's
                best-known classicist."

                Mary Beard is professor of classics at Newnham College,
                University of Cambridge. She is the author of eighteen books on
                society and culture in the ancient world, including Women and
                Power: A Manifesto (2017), The Roman Triumph (2007), and The
                Parthenon (2002). Since 1992 she has been the classics editor of
                the Times Literary Supplement, which also hosts her popular
                blog, A Don’s Life. Beard’s newest book,
                <em
                  >How Do We Look: The Body, the Divine, and the Question of
                  Civilization (2018)</em
                >, looks beyond the familiar canon of Western imagery to explore
                the history of art, religion, and humanity, from prehistoric
                Mexico to modern Istanbul. The book contains text and images
                that complement her episodes in Civilisations, the epic BBC and
                PBS documentary television series that premiered earlier this
                year.
