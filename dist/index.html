                Life"</a>. Her frequent media appearances and sometimes controversial
              public statements have led to her being described as "Britain's

              Mary Beard is professor of classics at Newnham College,
              University of Cambridge. She is the author of eighteen books on
              society and culture in the ancient world, including Women and
              Power: A Manifesto (2017), The Roman Triumph (2007), and The
              Parthenon (2002). Since 1992 she has been the classics editor of
              the Times Literary Supplement, which also hosts her popular
              blog, A Don’s Life. Beard’s newest book,
              <em>How Do We Look: The Body, the Divine, and the Question of
                Civilization (2018)</em>, looks beyond the familiar canon of Western imagery to explore
              the history of art, religion, and humanity, from prehistoric
              Mexico to modern Istanbul. The book contains text and images
              that complement her episodes in Civilisations, the epic BBC and
              PBS documentary television series that premiered earlier this
              year.

          <h2>Theaster Gates</h2>
          <h2>Artist and 2020 Resident</h2>
          <div class="about">
            <p>
              Theaster Gates has developed an expanded artistic practice that includes space development, object
              making,
              performance and critical engagement with many publics. He transforms spaces, institutions, traditions,
              and
              perceptions.</p>

            <p>Gates’s training as an urban planner and sculptor, and subsequent time spent studying clay, has given
              him
              keen awareness of the poetics of production and systems of organizing. Playing with these poetic and
              systematic interests, Gates has assembled gospel choirs, formed temporary unions, and used systems of
              mass
              production as a way of underscoring the need that industry has for the body.</p>

          <p>Gates is a professor at the University of Chicago in the Department of Visual Arts. He also serves as
            senior
            advisor for cultural innovation and advisor to the dean. Gates is director of artists initiatives at the
            Lunder Institute for American Art at Colby College Museum of Art and the 2018–19 artist-in-residence at
            the
            Getty Research Institute.</p>
