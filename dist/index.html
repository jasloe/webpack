              <p>
                She is Professor of Classics at the University of Cambridge, a
                fellow of Newnham College, and Royal Academy of Arts Professor
                of Ancient Literature. She is the Classics editor of The Times
                Literary Supplement, where she also writes a regular blog,
                <a href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/categories/regular-features/mary-beard-a-dons-life/">"A Don's
                  Life"</a>. Her frequent media appearances and sometimes controversial
                public statements have led to her being described as "Britain's
                best-known classicist."

                Mary Beard is professor of classics at Newnham College,
                University of Cambridge. She is the author of eighteen books on
                society and culture in the ancient world, including Women and
                Power: A Manifesto (2017), The Roman Triumph (2007), and The
                Parthenon (2002). Since 1992 she has been the classics editor of
                the Times Literary Supplement, which also hosts her popular
                blog, A Don’s Life. Beard’s newest book,
                <em>How Do We Look: The Body, the Divine, and the Question of
                  Civilization (2018)</em>, looks beyond the familiar canon of Western imagery to explore
                the history of art, religion, and humanity, from prehistoric
                Mexico to modern Istanbul. The book contains text and images
                that complement her episodes in Civilisations, the epic BBC and
                PBS documentary television series that premiered earlier this
                year.

            <h2 class="step">Artist and 2020 Resident</h2>
            <div class="step about">
              <p>
                Theaster Gates has developed an expanded artistic practice that includes space development, object
                making,
                performance and critical engagement with many publics. He transforms spaces, institutions, traditions,
                and
                perceptions.</p>

              <p>Gates’s training as an urban planner and sculptor, and subsequent time spent studying clay, has given
                him
                keen awareness of the poetics of production and systems of organizing. Playing with these poetic and
                systematic interests, Gates has assembled gospel choirs, formed temporary unions, and used systems of
                mass
                production as a way of underscoring the need that industry has for the body.</p>

              <p>Gates is a professor at the University of Chicago in the Department of Visual Arts. He also serves as
                senior
                advisor for cultural innovation and advisor to the dean. Gates is director of artists initiatives at the
                Lunder Institute for American Art at Colby College Museum of Art and the 2018–19 artist-in-residence at
                the
                Getty Research Institute.</p>
